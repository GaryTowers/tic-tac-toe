# tic-tac-toe

This is an implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game using AngularJS.

## Features
- Choose between 3 game modes
- Show who the winner is
- Know if the game endend in a tie

## A few notes and assumptions
- Although the game only has 3 game modes, it is capable of generating an NxN size board with an arbitrary number for the win condition. Currently shows 3 only for user friendliness.
- The project was generated with angular-generator for Yeoman for quick scaffolding
- It uses `JS` for all the logic, `HTML` for the views and `SCSS` for the styling
- For better experience run the game on Google Chrome on a large display

## Build & development
1. Clone the project
2. Run `bower install` to get all the dependencies
3. Run `grunt` for building and `grunt serve` for preview.
